# Object-Oriented Programming â€“ NYU (C++)

This repository contains assignments, projects, and notes from my **Object-Oriented Programming** course at **NYU Tandon School of Engineering**.

The course focuses on writing modular, reusable code in **C++** using core OOP principles:

## Topics Covered
- Classes and Objects  
- Encapsulation and Abstraction  
- Inheritance and Polymorphism  
- Operator Overloading  
- Dynamic Memory Allocation and Destructors  
- Pointers and References  
- Header and Implementation File Separation

## Highlights
- Designed and implemented complex class hierarchies  
- Practiced memory-safe coding techniques  
- Developed reusable and maintainable C++ codebases

---

This repository demonstrates my progress in C++ and object-oriented design.
